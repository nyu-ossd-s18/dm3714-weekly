## Final Blog Post
In reflection on the semester as a whole, I did enjoy this course. I have never previously contributed to a project that was not mine, not even contributing to a group coding project. This class has given me more confidence and tools to contribute to projects that I think are worthwhile. It was nice to have Joanna and my classmates as a resource on how to make something that seems so incredibly dense and difficult seem accessible. I enjoyed the group setting, and whether we worked on an issue together or separately, having people to bounce ideas off of was worth its weight in gold. I wish I had some more time to make contributions, but I feel as though the class had enough time where now I am comfortable doing it on my own time, which is what is most important. The only thing I would take away from the class was the file system lectures, as I don't use Linux and just seemed like a regurgitation of information from CSO, and stuff that is easily findable on the internet if need be.
