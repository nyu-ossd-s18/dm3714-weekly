## Team Progress
We've finally made a pull request! After some work last weekend and early last week the team finished up the tests necessary to make our PR. Waiting to see what the community has in terms of feedback. The fix itself wasn't that hard, it was moreso dealing with the tests and adjusting them to reflect our work. I added the actual support of the week relative time feature, and corrected one of the few tests that were not passing. I also had the pleasure of making the pull request itself from our fork. Jason updated the documentation, and made a separate PR which I linked in my pull request.
