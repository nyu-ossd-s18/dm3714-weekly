## Questions for Danna
1. What are the pros/cons in working on open source projects with such a large corporation?
2. When did you get involved in OSSD, and what steps did you take that were most fruitful in your career?
3. What degree of change is Google making in the open source environment/culture?

## Group Project
So far, we have decided which issue we think we're going to attack. It is adding a feature for relative time, and we have found where this code would potentially go, as well as the pull request that originally put the feature there in the first place. I do think that this is something I can contribute to, as I found where the physical code was located, and are planning on coming up with a plan on how to do it with the workshop time and our usual Thursday meeting time. So far my specific role in the project is a logistical standpoint, I like to make sure we all have goals/timelines/milestones to keep the group focused and on track.
