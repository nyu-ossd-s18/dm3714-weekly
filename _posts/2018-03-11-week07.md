## Open Data Events

### NYU BUGS Event
This event was run by the Open Source club at NYU, which featured three panelists from various diciplines discussing the pros and cons of open data. I enjoyed the fact that these panelists were incredibly honest with their experiences. Each speaker was clear in labeling pros and cons in their own personal experienced. This helped in making the presentation not seem as propaganda-like. While open data is overall positive, I think that it is very important that the community points out benefits as well as flaws. It was nice to see how open data performs as its own sub culture and how they interact with entities like government. The talk wasn't overly technical which I think is good for average people to have a greater understanding to their cause.

### Data Through Design: Art Exhibit
This art exhibit was located in DUMBO and featured works of art created through the avaliablity of open data. To be honest, I was expecting a little more from this exhibit becuase I find the concept to be incredible, but I was left feeling underwhelmed. The exhibit was basically in an office building, and when I arrived it seemed like I was there interrupting a work day rather than going to see some art. Despite my issues with the location, the art itself was interesting to see. Most of the pieces featured layering to show data points over time with issues such as pedestrian accidents, sexual assault, or leading cause of death among New Yorkers. It was really need to see how the presentation and interpretation of data is what makes it compelling, and how open data can be used to educate en masse.
