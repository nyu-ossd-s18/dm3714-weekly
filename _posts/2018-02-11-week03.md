## Wikipedia Contibution

My Wikipedia edit can be found [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Khireitangiri&oldid=825165947). I contibuted to this article in particular, becuase Wikipedia recommended it to be shortly after creating my account. This article doesn't seem to be originally written by an English speaker, so there were a lot of examples of strange syntax. I was able to change a sentence that featured nearby villages in a list, and make it easier to read. I really liked the fact that Wikipedia immediately gave me an article that was easy to edit, as it shows how open they are to new contributers to the Open Source community.
