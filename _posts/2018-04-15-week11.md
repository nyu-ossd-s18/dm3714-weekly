title: Week 11 -- More Progress
---

## Team Project Update

This week we've all made a lot of progress towards making a pull request. I made the first commit adding support for the addition we're attempting to make. When the acutal instruction is run it returns true and passes all tests. What needs to be worked on now is accomodating the function with the other functions in the program. We've messed around a bit and have fixed many of the tests, but the implementations are a bit strange. We are all considering making a PR to hopefully get some guidance or input from the community on next steps.
