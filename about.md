Hi! My name is Dan, and I am currently a Junior studying Computer Science and Anthropology. My main academic interest involves how computers and culture intertwine to change our world. More specifically, I am fascinated in gender and sexuality minorities within the STEM fields and how technologies affect these marginalized communities. In terms of my other interests, I love female pop idols (Gaga, Lorde, Britney Spears, Beyonce, etc.) as well as embarassing memes and pop culture references that make me laugh too much.
